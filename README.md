# test-pyramid-e2e

## Getting Started

This is a simplified E2E framework based on [Webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io). To run the tests you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Use the latest LTS version, but anything newer will work as well.

Clone the repository on your computer and in the new repo folder, do `npm install`

Google Chrome is used to execute these tests, so make sure it is installed on your computer.

### Executing the tests

From the command-line do the following:

```bash
npx wdio --spec <test file goes here, example: tests/spySort.spec.js>
```
